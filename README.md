This code package performs hierarchical clustering of CO2 sources. It is recommended that users first open run_hierarchical_clustering.m - this is the main script. Information regarding the operation of the hierarchical clustering algorithm can be found in an accompanying journal paper (currently being prepared for submission to a journal).
